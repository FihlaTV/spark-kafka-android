Apache Spark App Demo


Step 1
Start zookeeper
verify zookeeper is running
run kafka server

start apache server in eclipse
start spark app on desktop

run mobile application
check system IP address
sorry phone got disconnected

light values are streamed from mobile to spark, which returns the word as per the light value - bright, normal, or dim

Thanks.
